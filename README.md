An e-commerce web application that uses a shopping cart of product items to allow a user to make online purchases from a list of categories and products for a Mountain Bike retailer. Uses an EJB (Session Bean) to create a transaction for the placing of orders. The purchase is handled by client-side PayPal which allows the buyer to make payments online via PayPal's card payment facility. Based on examples in the book 'Murach's Java Servlets and JSP' and the NetBeans E-commerce tutorial application 'AffableBean'.
